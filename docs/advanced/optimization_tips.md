# Optimization Tips

PSTL offers multiple ways to reduce overhead and maximize efficiency in embedded and high-load systems. By leveraging selective inclusion, optimizing memory usage, and focusing on compilation efficiency, PSTL ensures predictable performance even in resource-constrained environments.

## Selective Component Inclusion  

One of PSTL's core features is selective component inclusion, which allows developers to include only the components they need. This minimizes binary size and compilation overhead, making it particularly useful for embedded systems.  

```cpp
#include <portable_stl/memory/unique_ptr.h>

// Using only the unique_ptr component to reduce overhead
portable_stl::unique_ptr<int> myPtr(new int(42));
```

By avoiding unnecessary dependencies, this approach improves both build times and runtime efficiency.

## Minimizing Resource Usage  

PSTL provides tools to optimize memory allocation and usage, ensuring stability in low-resource environments.  

```cpp
// TBD
portable_stl::vector<int> myVector;
myVector.reserve(10); // Preallocate memory to avoid runtime reallocations
```

Preallocating memory or using custom allocators can significantly reduce runtime overhead in constrained systems.

## Compilation Time Optimization  

PSTLâ€™s header-only design and modular structure reduce compilation times by limiting the scope of included files.  

**Tip:**  
For faster builds, include only the essential PSTL headers required for your application. Avoid wildcard includes (`#include <portable_stl/all.h>`), as they can increase compilation times unnecessarily.

```cpp
#include <portable_stl/memory/unique_ptr.h>  // Include only what you need
```

Using this approach ensures quicker build times and more maintainable codebases.

## Compiler-Specific Optimizations  

Certain compilers offer advanced flags and settings that can enhance PSTL's performance. Developers can take advantage of these options to further optimize their applications.  

**Tip:**  
For GCC and Clang, consider using `-O2` or `-O3` optimization flags to maximize performance.  

```sh
g++ -std=c++14 -O3 -o app main.cpp
```

Consult your compiler documentation for additional options tailored to your target platform.
