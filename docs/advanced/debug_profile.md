# Debugging & Profiling  

This section provides guidelines and examples for debugging and profiling applications using PSTL, helping developers optimize performance and identify issues efficiently.

## Debugging PSTL Applications  

**Why Debugging Matters**  
Efficient debugging saves time and ensures code reliability, especially in resource-constrained or safety-critical environments. While PSTL does not include specialized debugging tools, it is fully compatible with industry-standard debugging solutions.  

**Placeholder: Examples**  
- Using `GDB` for line-by-line inspection in PSTL-based projects.  
- Debugging memory allocation issues with `Valgrind`.  
- Compiler settings for better debugging symbols.

## Profiling PSTL Applications  

**Why Profiling Matters**  
Profiling helps pinpoint performance bottlenecks, ensuring that applications run optimally in embedded and cross-platform environments.  

**Placeholder: Examples**  
- Identifying resource-intensive operations with `Perf`.  
- Using Intel VTune for performance analysis in high-load applications.  
- Strategies for profiling PSTL's selective component inclusion.

## Best Practices  

- Always enable debugging symbols (`-g` for GCC/Clang) during development.  
- Use memory check tools to identify potential leaks or misuses.  
- Profile early and often to catch bottlenecks before deployment.

## Future Work  

Further tools and examples will be added as we gather more feedback from users and extend PSTL's capabilities. Contributions are welcome!
