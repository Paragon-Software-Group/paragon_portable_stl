## About Portable STL  

Portable STL (PSTL) is your universal multi-adapter for modern C++ development, ensuring compatibility from bare-metal systems to resource-constrained environments while adhering to stringent industry standards.  

PSTL provides a lightweight and modular implementation of the C++ Standard Library, designed to meet the demands of embedded, cross-platform, and safety-critical applications. With a focus on portability, adaptability, and precision, PSTL simplifies development while delivering predictable and reliable performance.

## Advantages  

- **Portability and Adaptability**  
  PSTL is engineered for seamless portability, supporting bare-metal systems and OS-based environments alike. It minimizes platform-specific dependencies, making it ideal for IoT, automotive, and industrial applications.  

- **Flexible Error Handling**  
  Supporting both exception-based and exception-free modes, PSTL ensures predictable error management for a wide range of projects, including safety-critical and resource-constrained systems.  

- **Precision and Efficiency**  
  Fine-tuned memory management ensures stability and efficiency, while selective component inclusion reduces binary size and speeds up compilation.  

- **Ease of Integration**  
  With its header-only design and compatibility with standard STL libraries, PSTL integrates effortlessly into existing projects, enabling gradual migration and minimal disruption.  

- **Industry Standards Compliance**  
  Built to align with stringent industry standards like AutoSAR, PSTL is rigorously tested to ensure reliability in mission-critical environments.
