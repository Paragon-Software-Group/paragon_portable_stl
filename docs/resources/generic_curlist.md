## Algorithms and Data Structures

1. **[GeeksforGeeks - Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)**  
   _A comprehensive collection of tutorials and examples for implementing algorithms and data structures in C++. Great for interview preparation and practical tasks._

2. **[Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)**  
   _A foundational text on algorithms, often referred to as "CLRS." Covers theoretical concepts and practical implementations._

3. **[Open Data Structures](https://opendatastructures.org/)**  
   _A free, in-depth resource on data structures. Provides theoretical explanations and C++ implementations of key concepts._

## Tools and Utilities

1. **[Cpp Insights](https://cppinsights.io)**  
   _A powerful tool for visualizing how C++ code is interpreted by the compiler. Particularly useful for understanding templates, STL, and modern C++ features._

2. **[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org)**  
   _An interactive tool to experiment with C++ code and view its generated assembly. Supports multiple compilers and C++ standards._

3. **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org)**  
   _A suite of tools for debugging and profiling. Ideal for finding memory leaks and optimizing performance in C++ applications._
