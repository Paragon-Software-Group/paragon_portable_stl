# Curated List of STL Tools and Utilities

We have compiled a list of the most practical tools and utilities for working with the Standard Template Library (STL). These resources are designed to assist developers in analyzing, debugging, and optimizing STL usage in C++ projects.

## Performance Analysis

1. **[STL Perf Analyzer](https://example.com)**  
   _A performance analyzer for STL containers and algorithms. Provides benchmarks for different implementations, helping developers choose the most efficient structures for their use cases._

2. **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org)**  
   _A versatile tool for memory debugging and profiling. Ideal for finding performance bottlenecks and memory leaks in STL-based code._

---

## Code Insights

1. **[Cpp Insights](https://cppinsights.io)**  
   _Visualizes how STL constructs and templates are instantiated by the compiler. Perfect for debugging complex template code._

2. **[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org)**  
   _An interactive tool for exploring how C++ code is compiled into machine instructions. Supports STL constructs and various compiler optimizations._

## Testing and Debugging

1. **[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)**  
   _A modular testing framework that integrates seamlessly with STL components. Supports modern C++ features like lambdas and smart pointers._

2. **[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)**  
   _A widely-used framework for unit testing C++ code, including STL-based data structures and algorithms._

## Specialized Utilities

1. **[STL Compatibility Checker](https://example.com)**  
   _A utility to check STL compatibility across different platforms and compilers. Helps ensure portability in cross-platform projects._

2. **[STL Debug Helper](https://example.com)**  
   _An extension for debugging STL containers in IDEs. Highlights key container states (e.g., size, capacity) during runtime._
